MAKE SURE TO WRAP CELL for CSV

Question 1: 

Write a method called 'five' with no parameter that returns an int "5" 

ANSWER 1: 

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    if (five() != 5) {
        printf("Failed\n");
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed: Five() should be 5, but got %d\n", five());
    }
    else {
        printf("Success\n");
        fprintf(stderr, "Success: Five() is %d\n", five());
    }
    return 0;
}

CODE 1:

int five() {
    return 5;
}

QUESTION 2:

Write a method called 'absolute' with int parameter that returns absolute value of the number. 

ANSWER 2:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    if (absolute(-3) != 3) {
        printf("Failed\n");
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed: absolute(-3) should be 3, but got %d\n", absolute(-3));
    }
    else {
        printf("Success\n");
        fprintf(stderr, "Success: absolute(-3) is %d\n", absolute(-3));
    }

    if (absolute(7) != 7) {
        printf("Failed\n");
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed: absolute(7) should be 7, but got %d\n", absolute(7));
    }
    else {
        printf("Success\n");
        fprintf(stderr, "Success: absolute(7) is %d\n", absolute(7));
    }
    return 0;
}

CODE 2:

int absolute(int x) {
    return (x < 0) ? -1*x : x;
}

Question 3: 

Write an int function called 'diff' with two int parameters that returns the difference of the two numbers. 

ANSWER 3:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    if (diff(5, 3) != 2) {
        printf("Failed\n");
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed: Difference of 5 and 3 should be 2, but got %d\n", diff(5, 3));
    }
    else {
        printf("Success\n");
        fprintf(stderr, "Success: Difference of 5 and 3 is %d\n", diff(5, 3));
    }

    if (diff(3, 3) != 0) {
        printf("Failed\n");
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed: Difference of 3 and 3 should be 0, but got %d\n", diff(3, 3));
    }
    else {
        printf("Success\n");
        fprintf(stderr, "Success: Difference of 3 and 3 is %d\n", diff(3, 3));
    }

    if (diff(3, 6) != 3) {
        printf("Failed\n");
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed: Difference of 3 and 6 should be 3, but got %d\n", diff(3, 6));
    }
    else {
        printf("Success\n");
        fprintf(stderr, "Success: Difference of 3 and 6 is %d\n", diff(3, 6));
    }
    return 0;
}

CODE 3:

int diff(int x, int y) {
    return (x < y) ? y - x : x - y;
}
