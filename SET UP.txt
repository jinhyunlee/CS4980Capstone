SET UP

Set up Mongo first

Make sure to change php.ini (add: extension=mongo.so) 
Download my sample db file if needed.

Troubleshoot:
MongoClient uses localhost
GIVE RIGHTS TO ALL FOLDERS



Prior to running:
1. Run the server (I use apache web server from Manager-osx)
2. Run mongo (Command Line: mongod)
3. Run test.html
